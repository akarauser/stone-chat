Ollama Chat GUI

This Streamlit application provides a chat interface using Ollama for local model interaction. The script utilizes Streamlit for the user interface, Ollama for the chat API, and YAML configuration for settings and model descriptions. The application manages conversation history, model selection, and logging for debugging purposes. It employs session state management for persistence and efficient UI updates. Error handling and logging are implemented to improve the application.
